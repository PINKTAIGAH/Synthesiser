# Raspberry pi Synthesiser

A synthesizer was created using a combination of electronic circuits to control user input/output and a Python program to generate and output audio signals. The synthesizer was capable of producing monophonic and polyphonic audio signals of either user-generated signals via a custom oscillator, or from an external audio file. The synthesizer contained 11 keys which could be individually programmed by varying multiple audio parameters within a dynamic range of 1 to 500 arbitrary units.
